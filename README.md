# Nesnes

## Overview
Nesnes is a web application built to help users find laptop-friendly cafes in their area.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Backend**: Supabase (temporary : only aim is to collect data)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (shadcn)

## Functionality
Nesnes allows users to recommend new coffee shops through a form on the website. However, these recommendations won't be automatically added to the official list. Instead, a temporary table is used to store these recommendations. When a coffee shop recommendation appears more than 10 times, it is considered for addition to the official list, ensuring quality recommendations.

## Future Plans
- **Automated Integration**: While currently manual, there are plans to automate the process of adding recommended coffee shops to the official list in the future.
- **Improved User Interaction**: Constant improvements will be made to enhance user experience and make finding laptop-friendly cafes even easier.
